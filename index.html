            In a quaint village nestled among rolling hills, there lived an elderly man named Elias who lived in a cottage .
            Every morning, Elias would teach the village children. 
            The children eagerly awaited his daily lessons, learning to appreciate the elegance and logic behind every problem they encountered. 
            Today one of his students saw that the temperature for the mountain area was mentioned with a minus sign in front of the numbers. He was a little surprised. 
            Elias decided to teach him what negative numbers are. Will you help him with this?
